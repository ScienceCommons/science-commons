-MOOD on helping replications (Isen & Levin, 1972; Levin & Isen, 1975); a good one to do for several reasons:
	-probably news to most experimental (social) psychologists
	-great example because researchers probably dead or no longer practicing (report your methods & results well, because one day someone might care about your research after your dead!)
	-and also a great one to emphasize how we need to transition toward HRWP designs! mood definitely influences helping, but probably differently for different people, and probably differently on different occasions for the same individual!
