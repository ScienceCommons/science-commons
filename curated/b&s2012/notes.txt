-Embodiment of warmth
	Bargh & Shalev (2012) [honors Donnellan, and a quick one given i can input rs and Ns directly from my Beta site screenshot
	-Donnellan et al (2015) 9 studies
	-McDonald & Donnellan (2015) http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MTk5 (direct replication, Israel online sample)
	-Ferrell et al (2013) http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MTg3 (direct replication, U of T austin
	-Bargh & Shalev (2015) follow-up studies don't seem to qualify, but could ask Donnellan et al for their opinion (it wouldn't change the meta-analytic conclusions; come to think of it, probably should, because studies can be considered close enough methodologically (must be consistent!!)
