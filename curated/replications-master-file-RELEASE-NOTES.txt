Curated Replications Searchable Table release NOTES 
***Version 4.6.1 (December 2017)***

NOTES regarding "replication outcome" categories:
1. signal detected - consistent
2a. signal detected - inconsistent (larger) (same direction, but larger)
2b. signal detected - inconsistent (smaller) (same direction, but smaller)
2c. signal detected - inconsistent (opposite) (opposite direction or pattern)
3. no signal - consistent 
4. no signal - inconsistent 

1. replication ES 95% CI excludes 0 and includes original ES point estimate.
2a & 2b. replication ES 95% CI excludes 0 but also excludes original ES point estimate (rep ES is LARGER or SMALLER [but same direction] than original ES point estimate).
2c. replication ES 95% CI excludes 0 but effect direction (or pattern) opposite to original ES direction/pattern.
3. replication ES 95% CI includes 0 but also includes original ES point estimate
4. replication ES 95% CI includes 0 but excludes original ES point estimate 

in cases where signal is NOT detected, if rep ES estimate is LESS precise than original [i.e., rep ES CI is wider than original] , then the "inconclusive" label is added to warn readers that such replication should *not* be interpreted on an individual basis (but rather needs to be interpreted meta-analytically)
**if original ES CI not available, then "inconclusive" qualifier made based on sample size (i.e., if rep used smaller N than original, then "inconclusive" is added); 
***if original N not available, then "inconclusive" qualifier cannot be made and is thus left out of interpretation;
****if original ES not available, then "consistent" vs. "inconsistent" attribute cannot be made;

[insert Figure 1 from LCCV (2017)]

General notes:
- +/- reflects 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (NOTE: certain effect sizes are asymmetrical, e.g., eta-squared or odds ratio [OR]);
-N refers to total sample size (consistent with conventions in psychology; n refers to within-cell sample size;
-NR = not reported and/or not calculatable (NR can also apply to sample size)
-empty cells means that such study characteristic information doesn't apply to a replication *OR* that such info has not yet been curated;


Coming soon
-evidence/replication collection linked icon for replications that are part of an evidence collection (i.e., "Go to evidence collection this replication is part of.") [modification of this icon: https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/education-37/49/78-512.png]
-Bayesian replication outcome categories coming soon
e.g., 
-row background JS where alternate based on "factored" target.effect instead of alternating rows;
-further refinements of "replication outcome" categories (e.g., unresolved issue: when a signal *IS* detected, should we distinguish between "signal detected - consistent" vs. "signal detected - consistent (inconclusive)", latter case when rep ES estimate LESS precise than original...; it seems we indeed should (given that less precise estimates will sometimes by chance be consistent *or* inconsistent with original), but this seems to overly complicate things quite a bit!

concrete (consistent) example:
Boroditsky (2000) Study 1	d(N=56) = .63 ± .56	d(N=44) = .77 ± .66	Bonfiglio et al. (2016, Ashland) 	signal detected - consistent (inconclusive)??
vs.
Boroditsky (2000) Study 1	d(N=56) = .63 ± .56	d(N=64) = .65 ± .53	Allen (2016, MontanaSU) 	signal detected - consistent

concrete (inconsistent) example:
Ross & Wilson (2002) Study 2	d(N=357) = .21 ± .21	d(N=42) = -.76 ± .68	Capaldi et al. (2016, Carleton) 	signal detected - inconsistent (opposite) (inconclusive)??
Ross & Wilson (2002) Study 2	d(N=357) = .21 ± .21	d(N=229) = .38 ± .26	Baranski et al. (2016, UCRiverside) 	signal detected (consistent) (inconclusive)??




Known issues:
-special character problems (only some characters) for hover titles (e.g., Correll active.sample.evidence ) (given problem does NOT occur for <TH> column header titles, suspect it may be a problem in the DataTables JS functions???)
-sorting by rep.effort.type issue with ML #10 coming before ML #2

To update later (post-sunday):
-icons sprite in ECs on main page
-add text description for generalization branches in ECs (cleanliness priming done!)
-add footer with previous, current funders????


OTHER things to update (sunday!!)
-brief newsletter
