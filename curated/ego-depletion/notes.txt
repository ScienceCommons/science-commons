STUDIES & REPLICATIONS:

%%%GLUCOSE
of Gaillot et al., 2007, Study 7 [F-value attenuated interaction; self-control {avoiding video caption} impairement on stroop eliminated with glucose]
	-cesario & corker (PFD, 2010, unsuccessful)

of Gaillot et al., 2007, Study 8 [F-value attenuated interaction; mortality salience impairment on word fragment task eliminated under glucose]
	-Lane et al. (2012, PFD "successful", though way underpowered) http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MTQ1
	-Astrologo et al (2014, PFD, "successful") http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MjIz
	[but these replications should not be considered because they "replicate" a non-finding in the original study wherein they incorectly interpreted a simple effect within a non-sign interaction]

of Wang & Dvorak (2010) [F-value attenuated interaction; glucose on cognitive performance]
	-Lange & Eggert (2014) study 1  (unsuccessful)

%%%EGO-DEPLETION
of Schmeichel (2007, JEPG {OSPAN DV only}) study 1 [cohen's d; self-control {avoiding video caption} impairs cognitive performance {OSPAN working memory}]
	-Carter & McCullough (2013, control conditions [sucralose and unsweetened, ns = 90 and 48, resp]) unsuccessful direct rep (though effortful essay task in between IV & DV)
	-Lurquin et al. (2016, PLOS ONE) unsuccessful (with open materials and pre-registration!! 

of Muraven, Tice, & Baumeister (1998) Study 2 (thought suppression vs. control on anagram performance; cohen's d)
	-Murtagh & Todd (2004) Study 2 (their Study 1 might map onto an original study [stroop vs. control on handgrip performance])

of Sripada et al. (2014) (which used "letter e" manipulation from Baumeister et al.'s (1998) Study 4, but DV [MSIT] from Bush et al. (2003)
	-RRR: 24 direct replications [cohen's d]


[-Xu et al. (2014, PLOS ONE) 4 unsuccessful ego depletion replications {crossing e task on handgrip and stroop performance [community and undergrad samples]}
[unfortunately, none of the 4 reps map onto original studies frpm Gaillot et al. or Baumeister et al for both IV *and* DV]




[...look for more direct replications of Baumeister et al.'s (1998) Study 1 to 4 (and of Gaillot et al., 2007 studies 1 through 9!)]
-->OK but seems i'm mixing 2 different claims: (1)self-control impairs further self-control [ego depletion] and (2) self-control relies on glucose
NEXT STEP: go through studies in Hagger et al. (2010) to find direct reps for ego depletion studies "proper" (non-glucose related) {word doc suppl. appendices}


***Kurzban has 3 unsuccessful ego depletion effect reps (mentioned to me in an email), which were included in Carter & McCullough’s (2015, meta-analysis), though a quick look couldn’t find them; i could email C&M (CCing Kurzban) asking about this **or** just reply back to Kurzban for the details he sent C&M
--actually should email C&M, and M. Inzlicht more generally and ask them for a list of studies that qualify as sufficiently methodologically similar direct replications! (for either classic ego depletion or glucose effects).
--and also ask them about this most recent review paper (or conference talk perhaps?) where baumeister admits glucose hypothesis incorrect???


***looks like i'll need to go w/ r effect size given F-value attenuated interaction and then Cohen d's


External commentary:

http://www.healthandbehaviourchange.com/#!hagger-blog/fs7gi ("While we have some sympathy with this claim, we do not think it provides sufficient basis to dismiss the task as failing to tax self-control.", "sample size necessary to detect an effect at the p=.10 level with this effect size, assuming an a priori power of .95 and equal numbers in each of the depletion and control groups, would be 875 in each group (total N=1750).")
