STUDIES & REPLICATIONS:

%%%GLUCOSE
of Gaillot et al., 2007, Study 7 [F-value attenuated interaction; self-control {avoiding video caption} impairement on stroop eliminated with glucose]
	-cesario & corker (PFD, 2010, unsuccessful, http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MTIw)

of Wang & Dvorak (2010) [F-value attenuated interaction; glucose on cognitive performance {future-discounting}]
	-Lange & Eggert (2014) study 1  (unsuccessful)

%%%EGO-DEPLETION
of Schmeichel et al. (2003) Study 1 {attention video on cognitive performance (standardized test, i.e., 13 analytic GRE questions}
    -Pond et al. (2011) Study 3 {unpublished dataset, non-religious priming control; attention video on standardized test (10 verbal GRE); n=63, n=65}
	
of Schmeichel (2007, JEPG, study 1 {OSPAN DV only}) [cohen's d; self-control {avoiding video caption} impairs cognitive performance {OSPAN working memory}]
	-Carter & McCullough (2013, control conditions [sucralose and unsweetened, ns = 90 and 48, resp]) unsuccessful direct rep (though effortful essay task in between IV & DV)
	-Lurquin et al. (2016, PLOS ONE) (unsuccessful, N=200; with open materials and pre-registration!! 
	-Healy et al. (2011, JEPG) Study 1 (successful, N=38) {email re: data in relation to total vs. % of target words recalled and outlier}

of Muraven, Tice, & Baumeister (1998) Study 2 (thought suppression vs. control on anagram performance; cohen's d)
	-Murtagh & Todd (2004) Study 2  {thought suppression vs. control on anagram performance}

of Sripada et al. (2014) (which used "letter e" manipulation from Baumeister et al.'s (1998) Study 4, but DV [MSIT] from Bush et al. (2003)
	-RRR: 24 direct replications [cohen's d]



----Considered, but not retained for various reasons:
----------------------------------------------------

of Gaillot et al., 2007, Study 8 [F-value attenuated interaction; mortality salience impairment on word fragment task eliminated under glucose]
	-Lane et al. (2012, PFD "successful", though way underpowered) http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MTQ1
	-Astrologo et al (2014, PFD, "successful") http://psychfiledrawer.org/replication.php?attempt=MjIz
	[but these replications should not be considered because they "replicate" a non-finding in the original study wherein they incorectly interpreted a simple effect within a non-sign interaction]

of Schmeichel (2007, JEPG) study 2 {attention essay on OSPAN WM}
	-Darowski & Hambrick (2011) Studies p2 and p3 (unpublished dissertation studies, http://etd.lib.msu.edu/islandora/object/etd%3A1627/datastream/OBJ/view)
	[upon inspection of dissertation, the studies don't appear to map onto any of Schmeichel's 2007 studies]
	
-Xu et al. (2014, PLOS ONE) 4 unsuccessful ego depletion replications {crossing e task on handgrip and stroop performance [community and undergrad samples]}
[unfortunately, none of the 4 reps map onto original studies frpm Gaillot et al., Muraven et al., or Baumeister et al for both IV *and* DV]

-Myers (2010, Study 1 & 2, unpublished thesis w/ Kurzban)[study 1: typing task on Stroop performance; study 2: video attention on solvable anagrams, both don't map onto any original studies i'm aware of, including Muraven et al., 1998, Gaillot et al., 2007]


***looks like i'll need to go w/ r effect size given F-value attenuated interaction and then Cohen d's

Verbal summary:
*remember to mention that next steps should be using more appropriate/powerful designs, i.e., HRWP, as Inzlicht et al have started doing (https://osf.io/n4irh/ , https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/68584/1/Francis_Zoe_L_201411_MA_thesis.pdf )

http://www.healthandbehaviourchange.com/#!hagger-blog/fs7gi ("While we have some sympathy with this claim, we do not think it provides sufficient basis to dismiss the task as failing to tax self-control.", "sample size necessary to detect an effect at the p=.10 level with this effect size, assuming an a priori power of .95 and equal numbers in each of the depletion and control groups, would be 875 in each group (total N=1750).")
