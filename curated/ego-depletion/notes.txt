External commentary:

http://www.healthandbehaviourchange.com/#!hagger-blog/fs7gi ("While we have some sympathy with this claim, we do not think it provides sufficient basis to dismiss the task as failing to tax self-control.", "sample size necessary to detect an effect at the p=.10 level with this effect size, assuming an a priori power of .95 and equal numbers in each of the depletion and control groups, would be 875 in each group (total N=1750).")
