From an embodied cognition perspective, this result was interpreted as suggesting that important secrets weigh people down. Answering to mounting calls for the crucial need of independent direct replications of published findings to ensure the self-correcting nature of our science, we sought to corroborate Slepian et al.'s finding in two extremely high-powered, preregistered studies that were very faithful to all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i.e., same cover story, study title, manipulation, measures, item order, scale anchors, task instructions, sampling frame, population, and statistical analyses). In both samples, we were unsuccessful in replicating the target finding. Although Slepian et al. reported three other studies supporting the secret burdensomeness phenomenon, we advise that these three other findings need to be independently corroborated before the general phenomenon informs theory or health interventions.",2,"Embodied cognition,Secrecy,Concealment of secrets,Independent direct replication","{'N' : 240, 'd' : .18, 'power' : 99} | {'N' : 90,  'd' : -.32,  'power' : 96}",NA,doi: 10.1037/a0027598,NA,NA,"<a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/w6kv5/node/butpa/osffiles/results_deIdentified.sav/version/1/'>results_deIdentified.sav</a>, <a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/w6kv5/node/butpa/osffiles/mainSyntax_OSF.sps/version/1/'>mainSyntax_OSF.sps</a> | <a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/euzwh/node/efytw/osffiles/results_deIdentified.sav/version/1/'>results_deIdentified.sav</a>, <a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/euzwh/node/efytw/osffiles/mainSyntax_OSF.sps/version/1/'>mainSyntax_OSF.sps</a>, <a href='https://osf.io/efytw/osffiles/CIs_uriReplicationStandard.R/'>CIs_uriReplicationStandard.R</a>, <a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/w6kv5/node/butpa/osffiles/simonsohnApproachFigure.xlsx/version/1/'>simonsohnApproachFigure.xlsx</a>",<a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/w6kv5/osffiles/ReplicationProtocol_for_Slepian_et_al._2012_Replication_1_-_LeBel.doc/version/1/'>ReplicationProtocol_Replication_1_-_LeBel.doc</a> | <a href='https://osf.io/api/v1/project/euzwh/osffiles/ReplicationProtocol_for_Slepian_et_al._2012_Replication_2_-_LeBel.doc/version/1/'>ReplicationProtocol_Replication_2_-_LeBel.doc</a>,<a href='https://osf.io/tvszz/'>PreregistrationProtocol</a> | <a href='https://osf.io/54v2d/'>PreregistrationProtocol</a>,Exclusions: Full Disclosure | Measures: Full Disclosure | Conditions: Full Disclosure | Sample size: Full Disclosure,"<strong>Ase Kvist Innes-Ker &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> November 26, 2013<br>Calooo Calay, what a happy day!

The prevalence of this practice suggests a psychological association between bodily purity and moral purity.

This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansingrelated concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.

The act of washing their hands seems to free individuals of their guilt. However, the universality of this psychological mechanism is an empirical question that should be studied. In four studies we replicated the original Zhong & Liljenquist’s experiments with Spanish samples. We were unsuccessful in replicating the Zhong & Liljenquist´s results that supported cleansing as a psychological mechanism for compensating guilty: results couldn’t confirm an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts or even a greater desire for cleansing products, neither a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes.

In an attempt to replicate and build upon these findings, we conducted a pilot study in which we unexpectedly failed to replicate the original results from the second study of Zhong and Liljenquist’s report. To investigate the source of this issue, we conducted a series of direct replications of Study 2 as reported in Zhong and Liljenquist (2006). We used the authors’ original materials and methods; we investigated samples that were more representative of the general population than in the original experiments; we investigated samples from different countries and cultures; and we substantially increased the power of our statistical tests.

10.1037/a0021524,Feeling the future: Experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect.,"Bem, Daryl J.",Cornell University,2011,JPSP,Unknown at this time.,Unknown at this time. | Unknown at this time.,"The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by “time-reversing” well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43.

We reanalyze Bem's data with a default Bayesian t test and show that the evidence for psi is weak to nonexistent. We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal.
