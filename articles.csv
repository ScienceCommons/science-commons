10.1037/a0027598,Physical burdens of secrecy,"1,2,3,4",2012,15,Unknown at this time.,Unknown at this time. | Unknown at this time.,"The present work examined whether secrets are experienced as physical burdens, thereby influencing perception and action. Four studies examined the behavior of people who harbored important secrets, such as secrets concerning infidelity and sexual orientation. People who recalled, were preoccupied with, or suppressed an important secret estimated hills to be steeper, perceived distances to be farther, indicated that physical tasks would require more effort, and were less likely to help others with physical tasks. The more burdensome the secret and the more thought devoted to it, the more perception and action were influenced in a manner similar to carrying physical weight. Thus, as with physical burdens, secrets weigh people down.",4,"secrets,embodiment,metaphor,perception,action","{'&#935<sup>2</sup>(?) = ?', 'p < ?'} | {'IC-index = ?', 'CI95% = ?'} | {'p<sub>TES</sub> =?'}",NA,10.3758/s13423-013-0549-2 | scicom1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

From an embodied cognition perspective, this result was interpreted as suggesting that important secrets weigh people down. Answering to mounting calls for the crucial need of independent direct replications of published findings to ensure the self-correcting nature of our science, we sought to corroborate Slepian et al.'s finding in two extremely high-powered, preregistered studies that were very faithful to all procedural and methodological details of the original study (i.e., same cover story, study title, manipulation, measures, item order, scale anchors, task instructions, sampling frame, population, and statistical analyses). In both samples, we were unsuccessful in replicating the target finding.

The prevalence of this practice suggests a psychological association between bodily purity and moral purity. In three studies, we explored what we call the 'Macbeth effect' --that is, a threat to one's moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself. This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansingrelated concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.

10.1037/a0021524,Feeling the future: Experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect,"23,",2011,6,Unknown at this time.,Unknown at this time. | Unknown at this time.,"The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by 'time-reversing' well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43.

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychologyﾒs academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired resultﾗa procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label 'confirmatory,' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled 'exploratory.'

Through the use of the same priming procedures as in previous impression formation research, Experiment 1 showed that participants whose concept of rudeness was primed interrupted the experimenter more quickly and frequently than did participants primed with polite-related stimuli. In Experiment 2, participants for whom an elderly stereotype was primed walked more slowly down the hallway when leaving the experiment than did control participants, consistent with the content of that stereotype. In Experiment 3, participants for whom the African American stereotype was primed subliminally reacted with more hostility to a vexatious request of the experimenter.

Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes.

Recent research on embodied cognition has shown that feelings of social warmth or coldness can be induced by experiences of physical warmth or coldness, and vice versa. Here we show that people tend to self-regulate their feelings of social warmth through applications of physical warmth, apparently without explicit awareness of doing so. In Study 1, higher scores on a measure of chronic loneliness (social coldness) were associated with an increased tendency to take warm baths or showers. In Study 2, a physical coldness manipulation significantly increased feelings of loneliness. In Study 3, needs for social affiliation and for emotion regulation, triggered by recall of a past rejection experience, were subsequently eliminated by an interpolated physical warmth experience. Study 4 provided evidence that people are not explicitly aware of the relationship between physical and social warmth (coldness), as they do not consider a target person who often bathes to be any lonelier than one who does not, with all else being equal.

Using our own bathing/showering measures and the most current version of the UCLA Loneliness scale (Russell, 1996), we found no evidence for an association between trait loneliness and a composite index of showering/bathing habits in a combined sample of 1,153 participants from four studies. Likewise, the aggregated effect size estimate was not statistically significant using the same measures as the original studies in a combined sample of 1,920 participants from five studies.

Across four experiments, participants were primed with either spatial closeness or spatial distance by plotting an assigned set of points on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Compared with the closeness prime, the distance prime produced greater enjoyment of media depicting embarrassment (Study 1), less emotional distress from violent media (Study 2), lower estimates of the number of calories in unhealthy food (Study 3), and weaker reports of emotional attachments to family members and hometowns (Study 4).

Specifically, 4 experiments established that priming the stereotype of professors or the trait intelligent enhanced participants' performance on a scale measuring general knowledge. Also, priming the stereotype of soccer hooligans or the trait stupid reduced participants' performance on a general knowledge scale. Results of the experiments revealed (a) that prolonged priming leads to more pronounced behavioral effects and (b) that there is no sign of decay of the effects for at least 15 min. The authors explain their results by claiming that perception has a direct and pervasive impact on overt behavior (cf. J. A. Bargh, M. Chen, & L. Burrows, 1996). Implications for human social behavior are discussed.",4,"Priming of stereotyped behavior & adoption of that behavior, College students, Netherlands","{'&#935<sup>2</sup>(?) = ?', 'p < ?'} | {'IC-index = ?', 'CI95% = ?'} | {'p<sub>TES</sub> =?'}",NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0056515 | scicom9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0

A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as professor or soccer hooligan. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained.",9,NA,"{'&#935<sup>2</sup>(?) = ?', 'p < ?'} | {'IC-index = ?', 'CI95% = ?'} | {'p<sub>TES</sub> =?'}",10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.865,NA,"[[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[3,3,1],[3,4,1]]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,7

Because subsequent valuations are also coherent with respect to salient differences in perceived quality or quantity of these products and experiences, the entire pattern of valuations can easily create an illusion of order, as if it is being generated by stable underlying preferences. The experiments show that this combination of coherent arbitrariness (1) cannot be interpreted as a rational response to information, (2) does not decrease as a result of experience with a good, (3) is not necessarily reduced by market forces, and (4) is not unique to cash prices. The results imply that demand curves estimated from market data need not reveal true consumer preferences, in any normatively significant sense of the term.",6,NA,"{'&#935<sup>2</sup>(?) = ?', 'p < ?'} | {'IC-index = ?', 'CI95% = ?'} | {'p<sub>TES</sub> =?'}",NA,10.2139/ssrn.2352692 | scicom10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,26,10

However, subsequent studies showed inconsistent results while using different experimental protocols. To bridge the gap between conflicting prior studies, we replicated the anchoring effect in product valuations while also varying the experimental protocol. We examined whether the type of anchoring number (Social Security number vs. random number), recruiting method (classroom vs. email recruiting), or cover story (in-class market research demonstration vs. participation in research experiment) contributed to the divergent results. Our results replicated the anchoring effect at economically significant magnitudes (near the middle of the range for previous studies), but we did not find evidence that the procedural differences can account for the conflicting prior results.",2,"Anchoring effect, Product valuation, Preference elicitation","{'&#935<sup>2</sup>(?) = ?', 'p < ?'} | {'IC-index = ?', 'CI95% = ?'} | {'p<sub>TES</sub> =?'}",10.2307/25053899,NA,"[[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]",NA,NA,<a href='http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2352692'>Materials</a>,SSRN.jpg,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,27,6
