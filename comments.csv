What it actually shows is that after training on the game, older adults perform as well as younger adults who are playing that same game for the first time. It does not show that training allows the older adults can multitask as well as the younger subjects in any other context. For example, the training did not lead to differential improvements on an a dual-task outcome measure. The study had a small sample size (about 15/condition), and the analysis did not correct for multiple tests, meaning that it is not clear whether training led to any reliable improvements on the outcome measures. The paper also did not control for expectations in the training and control group, meaning that any differential improvements upon re-testing could be due to differential placebo effects.
