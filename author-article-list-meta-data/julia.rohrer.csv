In this study, respondents from a representative German sample reported ideas for how they could improve their life satisfaction in text format. We investigated which of these ideas predicted changes in life satisfaction 1 year later. Active pursuits per se—as opposed to statements about external circumstances or fortune—were not associated with changes in life satisfaction (N = 1,178). However, in line with our preregistered hypothesis, among individuals who described active pursuits (N = 582), those who described social ideas (e.g., spending more time with friends and family) ended up being more satisfied, and this effect was partly mediated by increased socializing. Our results demonstrate that not all pursuits of happiness are equally successful and corroborate the great importance of social relationships for human well-being.",,"J. M. Rohrer, Stefan C.

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.",directed acyclic graphs,,None to declare.,,DJ Simons,,

A major development is the use of preregistered sampling and analysis plans, which enable readers to distinguish between analyses meant to generate versus test theories.. However, these practices have tended to be most immediately applicable to experimental researchers and those who collect new data for each new study. Those whose research involves secondary analysis—modeling and predicting phenomena using pre-existing datasets—often believe they are unable to engage in many of these new practices. For example, because the data may have existed for many years, full preregistration is not possible. Nonetheless, there are many ways in which secondary analysts can increase the openness and transparency of their research. Here, we provide nine recommendations for integrating open science practices into analysis of pre-existing data, including being more open about previous work published on the same dataset and registering an analysis plan prior to statistical modeling. These recommendations are expected to be facilitated by a forthcoming registration template on the Open Science Framework. We end by anticipating potential objections to our recommendations.",open science; pre-existing data; preregistration; secondary analysis; transparency,All authors contributed to the writing and editing of this manuscript. ,None to declare.,,,,

How people spend these resources is in many ways determined by necessities and external constraints, yet research on personality-situation transactions shows that people also choose their environments to resonate with their personality. This finding implies that daily time use and individual traits should be correlated. However, few studies have linked modern methods for assessing time use to individual differences in personality traits. In this study, we investigate correlations between the Big Five traits and time spent on various daily activities in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), including 5,456 days in the lives of 1,364 individuals. Results converged towards previously reported personality-situation transactions. For example, extraversion predicted whether or not respondents reported meeting their friends, whereas openness was correlated negatively with watching TV. Effects were modest in size, ranging from r~~.10 to .25. Taking together, our findings corroborate the notion that our personality is robustly associated with the way we spend our lives.",Big Five; time use; personality-situation transactions; Day Reconstruction Method  ,"Substantial contributions to conception and design: JMR, REL.

This aggregation supposedly involves a weighting procedure because individuals care about different parts of their lives to varying degrees. Thus, composite measures of well-being should be more accurate if domain satisfaction scores are weighted by the importance that respondents assign to the respective domains. Previous studies have arrived at mixed conclusions about whether such a procedure actually works. In the present study, importance weighting was investigated in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; N = 5,049). Both weighted composite scores and moderated regression analyses converged in producing the conclusion that individual importance weights did not result in higher correlations with the outcome variable, a global measure of life satisfaction. By contrast, using weights that vary normatively across domains (e.g., assigning a larger weight to family satisfaction than to housing satisfaction for all respondents) significantly increased the correlation with global life satisfaction (although incremental validity was rather humble). These results converge with findings from other fields such as self-concept research, where evidence for individual importance weighting seems elusive as best.",well-being; life satisfaction; domain satisfaction; domain importance; weighting,Contributed to the conception and design: JMR; Contributed to analysis and interpretation of data: JMR SCS; Drafted and revised the article: JMR SCS; Approved the submitted version for publication: JMR SCS,None to declare.,"This work was supported by a travel grant from the International Max Planck Research School LIFE and made possible by the support of the hosting institution, the Health and Retirement Study at the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan.

Recent large-scale studies have indicated that birth-order effects on the Big Five personality traits are negligible. In the current study, we examined a variety of more narrow personality traits in a large representative sample (n = 6,500–10,500 in between-family analyses; n = 900–1,200 in within-family analyses). We used specification-curve analysis to assess evidence for birth-order effects across a range of models implementing defensible yet arbitrary analytical decisions (e.g., whether to control for age effects or to exclude participants on the basis of sibling spacing). Although specification-curve analysis clearly confirmed the previously reported birth-order effect on intellect, we found no meaningful effects on life satisfaction, locus of control, interpersonal trust, reciprocity, risk taking, patience, impulsivity, or political orientation. The lack of meaningful birth-order effects on self-reports of personality was not limited to broad traits but also held for more narrowly defined characteristics.",birth-order effects; siblings; trust; risk taking; reciprocity; political attitudes; specification-curve analysis; open materials,"All the authors developed the study concept.

Empirical research on the relation between birth order and intelligence has convincingly documented that performances on psychometric intelligence tests decline slightly from firstborns to later-borns. By contrast, the search for birth-order effects on personality has not yet resulted in conclusive findings. We used data from three large national panels from the United States (n = 5,240), Great Britain (n = 4,489), and Germany (n = 10,457) to resolve this open research question. This database allowed us to identify even very small effects of birth order on personality with sufficiently high statistical power and to investigate whether effects emerge across different samples. We furthermore used two different analytical strategies by comparing siblings with different birth-order positions (i) within the same family (within-family design) and (ii) between different families (between-family design). In our analyses, we confirmed the expected birth-order effect on intelligence. We also observed a significant decline of a 10th of a SD in self-reported intellect with increasing birth-order position, and this effect persisted after controlling for objectively measured intelligence. Most important, however, we consistently found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination. On the basis of the high statistical power and the consistent results across samples and analytical designs, we must conclude that birth order does not have a lasting effect on broad personality traits outside of the intellectual domain.",birth order; personality; Big Five; within-family analyses; siblings,"B.E. and S.C.S. designed research; J.M.R. and S.C.S. analyzed data; and J.M.R., B.E., and S.C.S. wrote the paper.
