"EP LeBel, W Vanpaemel, I Cheung, & L Campbell",in press,A brief guide to evaluate replications,Meta-Psychology,,,,,,,,https://osf.io/paxyn/,,211,"January 17, 2019",,,,,,,,conceptual,,,,,"The importance of replication is becoming increasingly appreciated, however, considerably less consensus exists about how to evaluate the design and results of replications. We make concrete recommendations on how to evaluate replications with more nuance than what is typically done currently in the literature. We highlight six study characteristics that are crucial for evaluating replications: replication method similarity, replication differences, investigator independence, method/data transparency, analytic result reproducibility, and auxiliary hypothesesâ€™ plausibility evidence. We also recommend a more nuanced approach to statistically interpret replication results at the individual-study and meta-analytic levels, and propose clearer language to communicate replication results.",transparency;  reproducibility;  direct replication;  replicability;  evaluating replications,,None to declare.,"European Commission (Marie-Curie grant, Project ID: 793669: EP LeBel, W Vanpaemel)",R Carlsson,MB Nuijten; U Schimmack,https://osf.io/dsn72/

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
