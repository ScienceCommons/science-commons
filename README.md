Curate Science
==============

*Food Labels for Science*

Code of the temporary alpha page of **[Curate Science](http://CurateScience.org)**, a web platform that provides *food labels for scientific articles*. **Science requires transparency**, however, no platform currently exists to ensure that published scientific articles comply with the relevant transparency standards. Curate Science aims to solve this problem by allowing researchers to _label_, _link_, and _organize_ the transparency **and** replications of published findings. For more details, see [our white paper](https://etiennelebel.com/documents/lebeletal(2018,ampss)a-unified-framework-to-quantify-the-credibility-of-scientific-findings.pdf).
