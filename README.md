=============
<i>Curating Key Information about Published Scientific Articles</i>

<p>This repository hosts the codebase for CurateScience.org, an online platform that curates fundamental information about published scientific articles. </p>

<p>
              Replicability is a cornerstone of science, but evidence of independent replications is currently disorganized, making it difficult to gauge the reliability of empirical findings. Independent verification of data and analyses is another hallmark of science, yet is currently challenging in practice because data/syntax are difficult to track down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curate-Science aims to solve both of these problems by providing an online platform that substantially facilitates these two crucial processes of science. Independent replication information and available data/syntax files will automatically be aggregated from pre-existing sources (e.g., from <a href="http://PsychFileDrawer.org">PsychFileDrawer.org</a>, <a href="http://www.figshare.com">Figshare.com</a>). Registered users will be able to add, modify, and update such information, including in-line commenting directed at specific elements of an article and in-browser analyses for articles with available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a> syntax files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our vision is that building such a platform will accelerate the growth of cumulative knowledge and innovation by facilitating and incentivizing independent replications and verification, but also by facilitating the post-publication critique, evaluation, extension, re-analysis, and interpretation of findings (see <a href="#section-3">Features</a>, for a flowchar of our core features).
