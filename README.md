<i>Organizing the World’s Scientific Information all in One Public Place</i>

This repository hosts the codebase for Science-Commons.org, an online platform that aims to organize the world’s scientific information all in one public place as to maximize the quality of and accessibility to scientific information for all (benefiting not only working researchers, but also laypeople, educators, and public policy makers). 

For each article as much of the following information will be posted/available:
<ul>
<li>direct links to raw data/syntax, experimental materials, and pre-registrationp protocols</li>
<li>post-publication comments from various sources</li>
<li>peer reviewer information</li>
<li>information about (and direct links to) follow-up independent direct/conceputal replications</li>
<li>display of important statistical information (and disaply of publication bias indices)</li>
<li>disclosure of unreported methodological details</li>
<li>figures, graphs, interactive graphs, videos</li>
<li>ability to confirm reproducibility of analyses and graphs for articles linked to raw data/syntax</li>
<li>direct links to open-access full-text and to SSRN pre-print version of article</li>
<li>display of social media presence (news stories, tweets, or blog posts about the article)</li>
<li>display of alternaive metrics (altmetrics.org) of article's impact</li>
</ul>

This will be accomplished by aggregating information from several pre-existing sources (e.g., PubMed, PubMedCommons, PubPeer.com, Mendeley, ImpactStory, open-access journals, SSRN, data repositories, and other open-science initiatives, e.g., OpenScienceFramework, ArchivalProject.org, PsychFileDrawer.org, PsychDisclosure.org). Other information will be user-inputted in a crowd-sourced manner like Wikipedia, with some information involving both automatic aggregation and human interaction. The information will be organized at the article-level, following on the footsteps of PubMed (basically a highly augmented version of the PubMed interface).
